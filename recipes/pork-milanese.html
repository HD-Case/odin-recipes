    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A variety of breaded cutlet from the city of Milan, Italy.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 Pork Loin Cutlets, pounded</li>
        <li>2 eggs, scrambled</li>
        <li>All Purpose Flour, seasoned with salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. Butter</li>
        <li>2 Garlic Cloves, halved</li>
        <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Black Pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by preparing the pork loin cutlets. Cut a few slits into the fat of the pork loin cutlets to keep from curling 
            up when cooked.</li>
        <li>Place the pork loin cutlets on a piece of saran wrap and cover with another piece of saran wrap. Pound the pork loin 
            cutlets to make the pork more tender and to even out the pieces to cook evenly. Season each cutlet with salt and 
            pepper.</li>
        <li>Next, scramble the eggs with a pinch of salt and black pepper in a shallow dish. Place the flour on a flat dish and 
            season with a pinch of salt and black pepper. Place the breadcrumbs on a flat dish. Dip the pork loin cutlet, 
            working with one at a time, and lightly pat each side on the flour dish. Shake off any excess and then 
            dip into the egg mix, allowing the excess to drip off. Lastly, pat each side of the pork loin cutlet on the breadcrumbs 
            and shake off any excess and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a saute pan, add a large drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and heat up over low heat. Add in the garlic. 
            Once sizzling, add in the butter and stir until completely melted. Add each pork loin cutlet and 
            fry each side for about three to four minutes, until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove the Pork Milanese from the pan and serve with a side of arugula salad or roasted potatoes. 
            Salute and cin cin!</li>
